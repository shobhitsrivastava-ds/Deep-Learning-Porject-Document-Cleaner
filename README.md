<p> This is one of major project of my undergraduate degree program.</p>
<p>Here I have developed a document cleaner web app which using the Encoder and Decoder concept in Deep Learning cleans the shadowed pdf pages and other images uploaded by the user.</p>
<p> For Developing the project I have used Flask Framework as base. I have used HTML and CSS for developing basic structure of the project.
  All the coding part is implemented using Python Language.</p>
 <h3> For using the project use the following commands : </h3>
 <ul>
  <li> $ git clone <repo link> </li>
  <li> $ set FLASK_APP= app.py</li>
  <li> $ flask run</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p> The whole project is deployed on Heroku Cloud.
  
 <p> Here is the link where you can access the project live : https://my-document-cleaner.herokuapp.com/ <p>
